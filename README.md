Welcome. This educational project focuses on solving the fascinating Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various algorithmic approaches in C++.

## üöÄ Algorithms

In this repository, I have implemented three algorithms to tackle the TSP:

1. **Brute Force** (`bruteforcetsp.cpp`): üí™
   - Explores all possible permutations of the vertices to find the optimal solution.
   - Time complexity: O(n!), where n is the number of vertices.
   - Guarantees the best solution but becomes impractical for large instances.

2. **Greedy Approach** (`greedytsp.cpp`): üß©
   - Builds the TSP tour by making locally optimal choices at each step.
   - Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of vertices.
   - Provides a fast approximation but may not always yield the optimal solution.

3. **Simplified Christofides-like Algorithm** (`christofidestsp.cpp`): üåø
   - Combines minimum spanning tree and nearest neighbor techniques.
   - Offers a balance between efficiency and solution quality.
   - Simplified version and may not always produce the optimal solution.
  
## üìä Input Data

The TSP instance is represented by a distance matrix (`dist`) for a complete graph with 5 vertices:

```
0 3 4 2 7
3 0 4 6 3
4 4 0 5 8
2 6 5 0 6
7 3 8 6 0
```

### üîç Data Source

- The distance matrix is synthetically generated to create a meaningful TSP instance.
- Distances are symmetric, ensuring the TSP graph is undirected.
- Diagonal entries are zero, indicating no self-loops.
- The matrix is carefully crafted to introduce variance in distances, adding complexity to the problem.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timings

To showcase the performance of each algorithm, I have measured the estimated execution time for the given TSP instance with 5 vertices:

| Algorithm           | Estimated Time (s) | Largest n in 30 min |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Brute Force (O(n!)) | 0.0002             | 10                 |
| Greedy (O(n^2))     | 0.0001             | 400                |
| Simplified Christofides-like | 0.0001   | 400                |

As evident from the timings, the brute force approach becomes infeasible for larger instances, while the greedy and simplified Christofides-like algorithms scale better.
